## 🔬 Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Processing

#### 1.1 Content Extraction (`1_HEC_togath_llma3_2_3b_int_turbo.ipynb`)

**Objective**: Extract educational content from PDF textbooks and generate initial assignment questions.

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# PDF Processing Configuration
PDF_PATH = "/content/drive/MyDrive/ThesisDataRaw/AI-Book/AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf"
CHUNK_SIZE = 2000  # Words per chunk for manageable processing
MODEL_NAME = "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Turbo"

# Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) Integration
clo_array = [
    "Understand key components in the field of artificial intelligence",
    "Implement classical artificial intelligence techniques",
    "Analyze artificial intelligence techniques for practical problem solving"
]

# Content-Specific Topics
content_array = [
    "Explain the basic components of AI and identify AI systems with real-world examples",
    "Define and solve constraint satisfaction problems with practical examples",
    "Demonstrate adversarial search using the Min-Max algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning"
]
```

**Key Features**:
- **PyMuPDF Integration**: Robust PDF text extraction with metadata preservation
- **Intelligent Chunking**: 2000-word chunks optimized for LLM processing
- **Structured Prompting**: Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and topic integration
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large documents
- **JSON Output**: Structured data format for downstream processing

#### 1.2 Data Cleaning (`2_cleaner_Local.ipynb`)

**Objective**: Remove formatting artifacts and standardize question structure.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Regex-based cleaning patterns
pattern = r"\*\*.*?\*\*|\n\n"  # Remove markdown formatting and extra newlines

# Structured cleaning pipeline
for item in data:
    if "question" in item:
        item["question"] = re.sub(pattern, '', item["question"]).strip()
```

### Phase 2: Question Enhancement and Structuring

#### 2.1 Quality Improvement (`3_DataImprover.ipynb`)

**Objective**: Enhance question quality using few-shot prompting and generate professional PDF assignments.

**Technical Approach**:
```python
def generate_assignment_questions(input_text, logs=True):
    prompt = (
        "You are an AI assistant that generates high-quality assignment questions "
        "with a focus on structured problem-solving and coding implementation.\n\n"
        "#### Question: Implement a Vacuum Cleaner Agent\n"
        "A vacuum cleaner agent operates in a 2x1 grid with two locations that may "
        "or may not contain dirt. The agent can move left, move right, and suck dirt.\n\n"
        "**Tasks:**\n"
        "a) Define a state representation for the vacuum cleaner environment.\n"
        "b) Implement a Python class to simulate the vacuum agent with appropriate methods.\n"
        "c) Define an initial state and implement a function to transition between states.\n"
        "d) Implement a goal test function that checks if all locations are clean.\n"
        "e) Extend your solution to support a larger 2x2 grid environment.\n\n"
        f"Now, generate a new set of 1 assignment-style questions based on:\n{input_text}\n\n"
        "**Ensure:**\n"
        "- Each task builds upon the previous one, increasing in difficulty.\n"
        "- Tasks require coding-based implementation with structured sub-parts.\n"
        "- Questions cover conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and problem-solving.\n"
        "- Higher-order questions involve optimization, performance analysis, or real-world applications."
